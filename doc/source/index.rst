Welcome to GLedger : General Ledger's documentation!
====================================================


GLedger is a General Ledger program. It contains a Web application enabling you to view and update account information and an API to add postings in journals to the system. Accounts have balances, that can be queried by day, but also by accounting period. Asking for the balance of an account for accounting period 03-2016 returns the balance as per ultimo march 2016.
