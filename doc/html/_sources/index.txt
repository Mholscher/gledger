Welcome to GLedger : General Ledger's documentation!
====================================================


GLedger is a General Ledger program. It contains a Web application enabling you to view and update account information and an API to add postings in journals to the system. Accounts have balances, that can be queried by day, but also by accounting period. Asking for the balance of an account for accounting period 2016-03 returns the balance as per ultimo march 2016.

Account structure
-----------------

Accounts are structured as a tree. At the top there is the trial balance account. All accounts link to their parent, when you want to know what children an account has, you find the ones that link to this one as its parent. Any account can only have one parent, one account has no parent.

Journal processing
------------------

Journals can be entered through the API. Journals need to balance, the debit and credit entries need to add up to zero for each journal. Journlas, contain postings that will contain the account to post to, the value dat and the posting month. The posting month defaults to the current month, but for corrections it is possible to post to another posting month.

To prevent accidental updating of posting months that are considered done, these can be closed. This prevents the system from accepting postings, actually all of the journal will be rejected.
