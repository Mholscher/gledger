GLedger - The application
=========================

The GLedger module contains the application level code for the GLedger application.

Views
-----

The views are the transactions that GLedeger is able to perform. See the reference below to find out what web transactions are supported.

.. note: not all views supported
   
   Some of the routes will show only a string describing what will be shown here. Those routes will be implemented later or removed, At the start all routes were generated and afterwards I decided whether to use these.
